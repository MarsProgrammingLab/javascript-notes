# Data Types

JavaScript has dynamic typing and data types do not need to be manually defined
for variables. They are determined automatically

## Primitive

- Number
  - Floating point numbers
  - Used for decimals and integers
- String
  - Sequence of characters
  - Used for text
- Boolean
  - Logical type that can only be true or false
  - Used for taking decisions
- Undefined
  - Vale not yet defined or empty
- Null
  - Also means 'empty value'
- Symbol
  - Value that is unique and cannot be changed
- Bigint
  - Larger integers than the Number type can hold
